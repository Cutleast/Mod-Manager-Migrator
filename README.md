# ‚ùóWARNING!!!

**This is in a very early Alpha stage and issues/errors are very likely to occur! Use at your own risk!**


# üìÑDescription

This is a tool for migrating modding instances between various mod managers (currently only Vortex to MO2). This program is in a very early Alpha stage and feedback is crucial for me to continue developing. Currently only Skyrim SE from Vortex to ModOrganizer 2 (MO2) is supported with support for more games and mod managers planned. **Only Windows is supported!**


# üïπFeatures

- create mod order from Vortex conflict rules
- fully automated migration
- new instance is customizable

### Planned Features

- Vortex as migration destination
- hardlink method to use same files between mod managers
- support for more games (suggestions are welcome)
- support for more mod managers (suggestions are also welcome)


# üîßUsage

To migrate an instance from Vortex to MO2, for example, follow these steps:

1. Start Vortex and make sure that the profile you want to migrate is deployed.
2. Close Vortex and start MMM (Mod Manager Migrator).
3. Click on "Add source", select Vortex and click on "Next".
4. Select the staging folder of Vortex and click on "Done".
5. Click on "Add destination", select MO2 and click on "Next".
6. Set paths name as you like it and click on "Done".
