# Mod-Manager-Migrator
This is a tool for migrating modding instances between various mod managers (currently only Vortex to MO2). This program is in a very early Alpha stage and feedback is crucial for me to continue developing. Currently only Skyrim SE from Vortex to ModOrganizer 2 (MO2) is supported with support for more games and mod managers planned.
