2. Clone repository
3. Open terminal in repository folder
4. Type in following command to set up virtual environment and install all requirements:
   `setup_venv.bat`
5. Activate virtual environment by typing:
   `src\venv\Scripts\activate`

### 4. Execute from source

2. Open terminal in src folder

   `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Execute main file:

### 5. Compile and build executable

3. The executable and its dependencies are created in the main.dist-Folder.

# üíªHow it works

### Mod order from Vortex conflict rules:

1. It reads Vortex's level database
2. Creates dict of mods and overwriting mods
3. A load order is constructed according to the overwrites

### Vortex conflict rules from mod order

1. Scans all files in all mods
2. Checks for overwritten mods
3. Creates a rule for every overwritten mod
