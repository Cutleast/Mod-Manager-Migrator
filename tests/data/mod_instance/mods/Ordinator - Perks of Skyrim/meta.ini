A full list of changes is in the Readme.\n<br />\n<br />This file is optional. If you want to use a different thief skills overhaul, a combat overhaul that includes stealth changes or if you prefer the vanilla settings, do not use this file.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][font=bebas_neuebook][color=#e1e1e1]NPCs get Ordinator perks[/color][/font][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Ordinator replaces vanilla perks used by NPCs with equivalent new weapon, magic and/or armor perks. For instance, if a spellcaster has Intense Flames level 1 in vanilla, this perk is replaced with Combustion level 1 and Scarring Burns level 1 from Ordinator. This is a result of the perks changing, not the NPCs, so this is compatible with every other mod.\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook][color=#e1e1e1]Recommended mods[/color][/font][/size]\n<br />\n<br />Ordinator is part of a cycle of vanilla-plus gameplay overhauls that combine to form \"Full size Enairim\", designed to greatly expand character building depth and variety:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090]Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim[/url][/*]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000]Odin - Skyrim Magic Overhaul[/url][/*]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137]Ordinator - Perks of Skyrim[/url][/*]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315]Imperious - Races of Skyrim[/url][/*]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14910]Andromeda - Unique Standing Stones of Skyrim[/url][/*]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1368]Wildcat - Combat of Skyrim[/url][/*]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6285]Summermyst - Enchantments of Skyrim[/url][/*]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1460]Thunderchild - Epic Shouts and Immersion[/url][/*]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245]Growl - Werebeasts of Skyrim[/url][/*]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3928]Sacrosanct - Vampires of Skyrim[/url][/*]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506]Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim[/url][/*]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170]Triumvirate - Mage Archetypes[/url][/*]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />My \"full size\" overhauls can be used interchangeably with my \"V++\" overhauls, which are more vanilla-plus and stay closer to vanilla Skyrim balancing, at the cost of some of the more crazy features.

This can take up to several minutes and a message is displayed when the process is complete. If you are switching from another perk mod, follow the instructions in its mod description to refund your perk points before uninstalling.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#888888][b]Uninstallation procedure:[/b][/color] Refund your perk points (see below) before uninstalling.\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][font=bebas_neuebook][color=#e1e1e1]FAQ[/color][/font][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]How do I refund my perk points (respec):[/b][/color] Make the skill legendary or use the perk refund feature in Apocrypha. [i]Cheat:[/i] Refund perk points at any time by taking 5 Daedra Hearts to a cooking pot and crafting a Scroll of Legends.[/*]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]I meet all of the requirements for a perk but still can't put a point into it:[/b][/color] You have another mod loaded below Ordinator that modifies those perks. Load it above Ordinator.[/*]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]Some perks or skill trees are still vanilla:[/b][/color] You have another mod loaded below Ordinator that modifies those perks or skill trees. Load it above Ordinator.[/*]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]Are critical strikes overpowered:[/b][/color] Critical damage in Skyrim does not work the way it does in other games. It is not a multiplier to your total damage, but a value that is roughly equal to half of your weapon's unmodified base damage. For instance, a daedric greatsword deals 12 extra damage on a critical strike regardless of skill, smithing or enchantments. The large critical damage bonuses in Ordinator ensure that critical hits are actually useful.[/*]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]Most of the one-handed/two-handed perks don't do anything:[/b][/color] You have another mod that adds a hidden Combat Hit Spell perk with maximum priority, which will override all of Ordinator's Combat Hit Spell perks, disabling them regardless of load order. This is a design flaw on the part of the other mod. This will affect all perk overhauls, not just Ordinator. Unfortunately, this includes the Bloodlust sword from the Dawnfang/Duskfang Creation Club DLC.[/*]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]There are several perks named \"NPC Perk\":[/b][/color] You have another mod loaded below Ordinator that modifies the same skill trees, overriding them with the vanilla ones. Load it above Ordinator.[/*]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]I'm having huge script lag:[/b][/color] This mod is very lightweight and does not cause significant script lag. It features no persistent scripts and very few scripted effects in general. However, certain combat overhauls are inefficently designed and will run a heavy script whenever any actor is struck by anything, including harmless or friendly effects, potentially leading to script overload. This is a design flaw on the part of the combat overhaul and you should replace it. If you can't or don't want to do this, avoid perks that affect other actors, such as Imposing Presence.[/*]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]The perks Quick Shot/Hailstorm greatly reduce my attack speed:[/b][/color] Quick Shot is a vanilla Skyrim perk and has a bug where it sometimes loses its attack speed bonus, reverting it from 1.30 to 0. This means any attack speed bonus will increase the attack speed to a value above 0 but probably less than 1, so your attack speed decreases instead of increases. The fix consists of refunding your perk points. Note that this bug (the ability condition bug, where conditional abilities get stuck in the on or off position) is prevalent in vanilla Skyrim as well and is not caused by Ordinator.[/*]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]My perk worked and then suddenly it stopped working:[/b][/color] This is the ability condition bug as described in the previous FAQ item. Refund your perk points.[/*]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]The perk Arcane Blacksmith is not refunded:[/b][/color] This is a vanilla Skyrim perk and has a bug where removing the perk from your character breaks it permanently. So Ordinator doesn't let you do that.[/*]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]The perks Ranger, Quick Shot and Block Runner have no effect:[/b][/color] These are vanilla Skyrim perks with a peculiar bug. If you had those perks at any point during your playthrough, removing them does not remove the effect. Additionally, Ranger in particular has another bug where it has no effect if you take the perk while sneaking. Note that all of this also applies to the same perks in the vanilla game. See [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Archery]the UESP page[/url] for more information.[/*]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]Fistfights (brawls) immediately end or turn into a real fight:[/b][/color] The \"[b]Brawl Bug[/b]\" is a common issue with many gameplay mods and hard to avoid due to the way Skyrim brawls are implemented. Ordinator comes with a copy of the [color=#aaffaa]Modern Brawl Bug Fix[/color] included to solve this issue. If it does not, you may have the outdated [color=#ffaaaa]Brawl Bugs Patch[/color] in your load order after Ordinator (as a standalone mod or included with another mod such as Enhanced Blood Textures). Either remove it or add the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1473]Modern Brawl Bug Fix[/url] to the end of your load order.[/*]\n<br />[*][color=#888888][b]Perk descriptions are truncated on 4:3 aspect ratio monitors:[/b][/color] This is a limitation of Skyrim.
